        <h1>IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION</h1>
    <p class="row">School is the basic foundation of knowledge being imparted to a child. It gives a chance to children to acquire knowledge on various fields of education, such as people, literature, history, mathematics, politics, and other numerous subjects. By obtaining knowledge, a person is in a better position to help other people. For example, you can calculate your taxes easily and speedily if you learn mathematics. Also, with better information, you can attract attention at a gathering by taking active part in the discussion.

        A Ladder to College
        Unless you complete your school education, you cannot get yourself enrolled into a college. College is highly significant to succeed and achieve your dreams. With higher education, you can get a good job and lead a better life. Without academic career, you will not be able to make a living for yourself, unless you are one of the very few exceptions.
        
        Allows You to Socialize
        Attending school gives you a chance to meet new children of your age. While some remain only classmates, some get close only to become good friends for many years or even lifetime. Conversely, if you stay at home all day long, you will probably not be able to meet many such people of your age. Meeting new people and socializing also broadens your parameters of knowledge. Thus, if you want to lead a good social life, it is best to attend school; else you might end up leading only a lonely life.
        
        Keeps You Engrossed
        Unless you are much occupied with various tasks, staying without work during the day can be really boring and tiresome. Isn’t it better to attend school rather than sitting idle the entire day? Not only will it keep you active, it will also help you learn other useful skills as well. Though you might enjoy staying unoccupied for the first few days or a month, after some time, it will get damn boring and kill you. Thus, attend school to be a happy, successful person.
        
        Overall Development
        Gone are the days when school meant just learning the events given in a history chapter or solving tough mathematical problems or reciting poems and sonnets! Nowadays, school has become the first stepping stone in the life of a child, wherein he/she learns a lot more than just rote learning. Developing hobbies, refining them, learning basic etiquettes, getting skilled at multi tasking, developing social skills are some of the many things that a school equips a child with.
